## 3. Sign in from CLI

Once your project is set up in [Adobe Developer Console](/console), let's move onto your local environment. You can always go back to [Adobe Developer Console](/console) to modify your project later.

1. On your machine, navigate to the Terminal and enter

    ```bash
    aio login
    ```

1. A browser window should open, asking you to sign in with your Adobe ID. If the window did not automatically open, you can also copy paste the URL printed in your browser to log in.

    ```bash
    $ aio login
    Visit this url to log in:
    https://aio-login.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/default/applogin?xxxxxxxx
    ```

1. Once you've logged in, you can close the browser window and go back to Terminal. You will see a string printed in the terminal. This is your user token. It is automatically stored in [CLI](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli) config, allowing the [CLI](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli) to use the token to talk to [Adobe Developer Console](/console).

    ```bash
    eyJ4NXUiOixxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

1. Now you can start building App Builder Applications with the [CLI](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli)!
