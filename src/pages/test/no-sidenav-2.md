title: Managing Sidenav Visibility for Pages Outside Configured SubPages
description: Explains why certain pages not included in the `config.md subPages` do not display a sidenav and how to control sidenav appearance.
keywords:
- sidenav visibility
- config.md subPages
- documentation navigation
- page configuration
- sidenav control
faqs:
- question: Why doesn't this page have a sidenav?
  answer: The page is not listed in the `config.md subPages`, so the sidenav is not generated for it by default.
- question: How can I add a sidenav to a page not in `config.md subPages`?
  answer: To display a sidenav, you need to include the page in the `subPages` section of `config.md` or configure the navigation settings accordingly.

This page isn't in `config.md subPages`, so it shouldn't have a sidenav.
