# Fragment Without Frontmatter

This is a fragment file that intentionally has **no frontmatter** at all.

When used as a fragment, it will be embedded into other pages, so it doesn't need its own title or description.

## Some Content

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

This file should trigger a frontmatter warning if the `skipFrontmatterPaths` config is removed.
